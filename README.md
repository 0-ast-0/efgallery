# efgallery: a straightforward photo gallery generator

*efgallery* is a static photo gallery generator written in Perl
with a minimalist look and feel. It shows your photos (and optionally
detects faces so they aren't cropped in the thumbnails).

*efgallery* stands for "extended fgallery" as it was inspired from
the `fgallery` 1.x version. During 2017 it received many enhancements
and was forked after the original developer said that he had moved
on, deserving a version bump to 2.x und a new name echoing its roots.

You can see example galleries here:

- https://www.thregr.org/~wavexx/software/fgallery/demo/ (fgallery version 1.x)
- https://marabu.ch/efgallery/demo/ (efgallery)
- https://alexschroeder.ch/gallery/ (sitelen-mute)

There is no server-side processing, only static generation. The
resulting gallery can be uploaded anywhere without any additional
requirements on the web server or browser.

- Automatically orients pictures without quality loss.
- Multi-camera friendly: automatically sorts pictures by time: just throw your
  (and your friends) photos and movies in a directory. The resulting gallery
  shows the pictures in seamless shooting order.
- Adapts to the current screen size and proportions, switching from
  horizontal/vertical layout and scaling thumbnails automatically.
- Supports face detection for improved thumbnail centering.
- Loads fast! Especially over slow connections.
- Includes original (raw) pictures in a zip file for downloading.
- Panoramas can be seen full-size by default.

This github repository will serve to cherry pick features coming
from the other fgallery versions out there and is the master site
for the [pkgsrc package](http://pkgsrc.se/wip/efgallery/).

## Usage

Generate all the static files with `./efgallery`:

```
./efgallery photo-dir my-gallery
```

Upload `my-gallery` somewhere.

To test or preview the gallery locally using Firefox, you can just
open the file `my-gallery/index.html` or `my-gallery/noscript.html`.

On other browsers you need a web server (due to [same-origin
policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy)).  If
you have Python installed, a quick way to test the gallery locally
is to run the following:

```
cd my-gallery
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

This serves all the files from `http://localhost:8000`.

## Pre-built packages

Pre-built packages for *efgallery* are not generally required as
it's just a Perl script and some static CSS and JavaScript which
can be installed manually.

That said, *efgallery* is a [pkgsrc](https://www.pkgsrc.org/)
package, and as such can be downloaded from there.

Otherwise, if you're lucky, you might be able to get pre-built
packages for your platform for the predecessor `fgallery` or
`sitelen-mute`.

Pre-built packages for the optional `facedetect` executable might
also be available from your distribution; the pkgsrc version includes
`facedetect` it as a dependency to *efgallery*.

## Usage notes

The images as shown by the viewer are scaled and compressed using the
specified quality to reduce viewing lag. They are also stripped of any
EXIF tag. However, the pictures in the generated zip album are
preserved *unchanged*.

Lossless auto-rotation is applied so that images can be opened with a
browser directly. JPEG and PNG files are also re-optimized (losslessy)
before being archived to furthermore save space.

Image captions are read from simple text files or directly from EXIF
metadata. Captions can be controlled by the user using the "bubble"
icon or by pressing the `c` keyboard shortcut, which cycles between
normal, always hidden and always shown visualization modes.

Preview and thumbnail images are converted to the sRGB color-space by
default, which provides better results on normal displays and browsers
without color management support.

All images can be included to be viewed individually at full
resolution in the gallery by using the `-i` flag. Panoramas are
automatically detected and the original image is included in full-size
by default, as often the image preview alone doesn't give it justice.

For best results when shooting with multiple cameras (or friends),
synchronize the camera clocks before starting to take pictures. Just
pick one camera's time as the reference. By doing this the album is
automatically shown in logical shooting order instead of file-name
order.

Never use the `-s` or `-d` flags. Let your friends and viewers
download the raw album at full resolution, not the downscaled crap.
Don't make me angry.

## Tuning thumbnail generation

The sizes of the thumbnails and the main image can be customized on
the command line with the appropriate flags. Two settings are
available for the thumbnail sizes: minimum (150x112) and maximum
(267x200). Thumbnails will always be as big as the minimum size, but
they can be enlarged up to the specified maximum depending on the
screen orientation. The default settings are tuned for a
mostly-landscape gallery, but they can be changed as needed.

Images having a different aspect ratio (like panoramas) are cut and
centered instead of being scaled-to-fit, so that the thumbnail shows
the central subject of the image instead of a thin, unwatchable strip.
When this happens, the viewer shows a sign on the thumbnail along the
cut edges (this effect can be seen in the demo gallery).

## Portraits and face detection

To simply favor photos shot in portrait format, invert the
width/height of the thumbnail sizes::

```
./efgallery --min-thumb 112x150 --max-thumb 200x267 ...
```

This will force the thumbnails to always fit vertically, at the
expense of a higher horizontal thumbnail strip.

If your photos are mixed and can contain people, faces or portraits, you can
enable face detection by using the `-f` flag and installing 
[facedetect](https://www.thregr.org/~wavexx/software/facedetect/).

Face detection will ensure that the thumbnails, especially when cut,
will be centered on the face of the subject. If face detection is
enabled, there's generally no need to increase the thumbnail size.

## Image captioning

Several sources for image captions are automatically read by *efgallery*.
These can be customized though the `-c` flag in the command line,
which consists of a comma-separated list of any of the following:

- `txt`: detached captions in a simple text file
- `xmp`: captions read from XMP sidecar metadata
- `exif`: captions read from EXIF metadata
- `cmt`: captions read from JPEG or PNG's built-in "comment" data

You can disable caption extraction entirely by using `-c none`. When
multiple methods are provided, the first available caption source is
used. By default, the method list is `txt,xmp,exif`.

The `txt` method reads the caption from a text file that has the same
name as the image, but with `txt` extension (for example `IMG1234.jpg`
reads from `IMG1234.txt`). The first line of the file (which can be
empty) constitutes the title, with any following line becoming the
description. These files can either be written manually, or can be
edited more conveniently using the `utils/fcaption` utility.
`fcaption` accepts a list of filenames or directories on the command
line, and provides a simple visual interface to quickly edit image
captions in this format.

`XMP` or `EXIF` captions can be edited easily with many other image
editing/previewing programs, such as
[Darktable](http://www.darktable.org/) (which writes XMP sidecar files
by default) or [Geeqie](http://geeqie.org/) (use `Ctrl+K` to bring up
the metadata editor).

Both JPEG and PNG have a built-in comment field, but it's not read by
default as it's often abused by editing software to put attribution or
copyright information. When enabled, the comment is parsed as for
`txt` files: the first line is the title, with any subsequent line
becoming the description.

Captions are intended to be short. Do not write long or distracting
descriptions. Captions should *never* contain copyright information.
*Do not abuse captions*.

## Color management

Since every camera is different, and every monitor is different, some
color transformation is necessary to reproduce the colors on your
monitor as *originally* captured by the camera.
[Color management](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_management) is
an umbrella term for all the techniques required to perform this task.

Most image-viewing software support color management to some degree,
but it's rarely configured properly on most systems except for Safari
on Mac OSX. No other browser, unfortunately, supports decent color
management.

This causes the familiar effect of looking at the same picture from
your laptop and your tablet, and noticing that the blue of the sky is
just slightly off, or that colors look much more contrasty on one
screen as opposed to the other. Often the image *has* the information
required for a more balanced color reproduction, but the browser is
just ignoring it.

We're writing this down because Firefox *has* built-in color-management
support, but it's disabled by default on all platforms. It's also ranking very
low on the list of improvements to make, with some bugs being open for years.
In an attempt to raise awareness, please complain/contribute to any of the
existing
[bug reports](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?component=GFX%3A%20Color%20Management&product=Core&bug_status=__open__),
citing the technical details below.

## Technical details

On Firefox, the installation of the
[Color Management](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/color-management/)
add-on is recommended.

When installed, in the add-on configuration, you'll need to enable
color management for "All images" and restart the browser. Also, if
you have a multi-monitor setup, it's advisable to manually set the
"Display profile" to the external/calibrated screen, since FF won't
automatically select the color profile for the current monitor, and
just default to the primary. Firefox has also known bugs with LUT
profiles, though the more common Matrix profiles seem to work fine.

We understand that CM has a considerable impact on image rendering
performance, but strictly speaking CM doesn't need to be enabled on
all images by default. It would be perfectly fine to have an
additional attribute on the image tag to request CM. The current
method of enabling CM only on images with an ICC profile is clearly
not adequate, since images without a profile should be assumed to be
in sRGB color-space already.

Because of the general lack of color management, *efgallery*
transforms the preview and thumbnail images from the built-in color
profile to the sRGB color-space by default. On most devices this will
result in images appearing to be *closer* to true colors with only
minimal lack of absolute color depth. As usual, no transformation is
done on the original downloadable files.

To save more space in the generated galleries, we recommend installing also the
optional dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get install jpegoptim pngcrush p7zip
```

`fcaption` is written in Python and requires PyQT4. You can install
the required packages with::

```

Installation is currently manual. If needed, copy the extracted
directory to a directory of your liking and link `efgallery`
appropriately:

```
sudo cp -r efgallery-X.Y /usr/local/share/efgallery
sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/efgallery/efgallery /usr/local/bin
```

## Authors and Copyright

[efgallery](https://github.com/0-ast-0/efgallery) grew out of the
initial version "1.x" [fgallery](https://github.com/wavexx/fgallery/)
developed by Yuri D'Elia.

Version "2.x" was started by Alex Schroeder which merged many of
my languishing pull requests to fgallery. He renamed it
[sitelen-mute](https://github.com/kensanata/sitelen-mute/) and
intends to continue development.

The original copyright GPLv2+ applies.

## Todo
