TODO:

- Preload next image
- Differentiate between normal and panorama shots in the thumbnail (black bands?)
- Handle panorama shots (allow to zoom/pan?)
- Slow animation in FF sometimes. Slowness detection doesn't work in these cases
- Maybe use CSS transitions and degrade with a simple swap?
- Show prev/next arrows at startup, then implement autohide
- Handle videos too
